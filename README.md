One of my first React projects to learn and implement full-stack development.

The project uses React with Axios to perfrom CRUD operations to a cloud based database on MongoDB.

### npm Start

To start the project run the above command in terminal
This will start your project in a browser on http://localhost:3000/

### cd backend
### npm start server

This will start a communication session with the database and load the data

### --- This is a platform I used to learn and implement React 
### --- and get a good understanding of interacting with the backend
